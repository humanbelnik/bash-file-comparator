This is the 2nd part of the test. It's really doesn't matter, what I 00.1   will write
there. What's really matter, is the floating point sequence. All previous  1.0e-10  test
files were different in addition to the needed sequences. So return code was a 22.22e10 lw 65 ays 1.
But now I'll put the same sequence     12.3 100e10 in this 1.1e10 file to show that my script can also return 0.
56.4e1
